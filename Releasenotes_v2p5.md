# Release notes for versions 2.x

**NOTE**
Even already the follow up of "dita13.lc.extra-interactions" already exists, "eu.xstructuring.dita.lce" v3p0,  
we decided to also make a new version for "dita13.lc.extra-interactions" because most vendors and clients still use "dita13.lc.extra-interactions".
The changes will also be transfered to a new version of "eu.xstructuring.dita.lce".
